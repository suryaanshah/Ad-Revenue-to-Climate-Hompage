There are many #extension for #chrome, #firefox that set the homepage to their sponsors in the name of donating the revenue to #climatechange  like #ecosia  
The only problem: None of them are #foss #opensource or #privacy oriented. 
Can we have a simple webpage that people can set as homepage that isn't #bloat #javascript or images, really #minimal website with #ad links which serve the same purpose or some other way of revenue for the cause.
